## The Old Status Signal

A long-running expectation in some organizations was that, past a certain level of seniority, continuing to write code signaled an inability to “let go” or scale impact [1]. The implicit status game rewarded management distance from implementation.

## What’s Changing

That perception appears to be shifting quickly: hands-on coding can increasingly be interpreted as a strength rather than a weakness, especially when it unlocks faster iteration, better technical judgment, and tighter feedback loops [1].

## Implications for Agentic Development

Agentic tooling changes the shape of “hands-on” work. Leaders can stay close to implementation without becoming a bottleneck by:

- Using agents to do the mechanical implementation while senior engineers focus on architecture, constraints, and review quality.
- Treating coding as a high-leverage way to validate assumptions (run small experiments, prototype, measure), then delegating scale-out.
- Modeling standards (“no slop”) in PR review, test strategy, and interface design—areas where senior judgment still matters.
