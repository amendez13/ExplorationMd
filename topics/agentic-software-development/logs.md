### [OpenAI's Internal Approach to Agentic Software Development](https://x.com/gdb/status/2019566641491963946)

Greg Brockman (OpenAI President) shares how OpenAI is retooling their teams towards agentic software development. He notes that since December there's been a step function improvement in what tools like Codex can do - engineers report their jobs have fundamentally changed, with agents now writing essentially all code and handling operations and debugging.

**Key Points:**
- Goal by March 31st: agents should be the tool of first resort for any technical task
- Designate an "agents captain" per team responsible for workflow integration
- Create and maintain AGENTS.md files; update when agent struggles with tasks
- Write reusable skills and commit to shared repositories
- Make internal tools agent-accessible via CLI or MCP servers
- Structure codebases to be agent-first with quick tests and clean interfaces
- "Say no to slop" - maintain code review standards for AI-generated code
- Build observability infrastructure around agent workflows
