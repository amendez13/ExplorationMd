### [OpenUsage - AI Limits Tracker for Cursor, Claude Code, Codex and more](https://www.openusage.ai/)
*2026-02-12* | Tags: openusage, ai-tooling, usage-tracking, limits, quota, menu-bar, open-source, plugin, providers, macos

OpenUsage is positioned as a lightweight menu bar app for monitoring AI tool usage limits without leaving your coding workflow. The landing page emphasizes background refresh, minimal setup, and a provider-as-plugin approach.

**Key Points:**
- Focuses on avoiding surprise lockouts by showing where you stand against limits
- Presents itself as “one download” from GitHub with minimal setup effort
- Claims automatic discovery of certain accounts (e.g., Cursor, Claude Code)
- Highlights a plugin-based, open-source model to keep provider support up to date
- Notes a Tauri/React/TypeScript implementation stack

### [OpenUsage GitHub Repository](https://github.com/robinebers/openusage)

The project repository documents OpenUsage’s feature set (menu bar UI, scheduled refresh, plugin-based providers) and provides downloads via GitHub releases. It also enumerates supported providers and contribution paths for adding new provider plugins.

**Key Points:**
- Distributes via GitHub releases for macOS; states the app auto-updates after install
- Describes a “one glance” menu bar UX with progress bars and labels
- Lists a broad set of supported providers (Amp, Claude, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
- Encourages contributions via a provider plugin model and a Plugin API
- Calls out Windows/Linux as a high-priority TODO needing testers
