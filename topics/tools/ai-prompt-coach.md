## What It Is

AI Prompt Coach is a web tool that analyzes an AI coding prompt and returns a numeric score plus rubric-style feedback. It’s described as using “15 proven principles” attributed to OpenAI and Anthropic research to help users write prompts that work better. [1] [2]

## How It Works

From the tool site and public example pages:

- **Prompt analysis:** A primary “Analyze My Prompt” action triggers an evaluation, with the UI noting that results can take ~20–30 seconds to generate. [2]
- **Scoring + breakdown:** Example pages show an overall score and per-principle items with pass/fail, reasoning, suggestions, and per-item scores, with some principles marked non-applicable depending on the prompt type. [3]
- **Examples library:** The site exposes example prompts with visible scores (both as cards and as a prompt/score table). [2]

## The 15 Principles (Rubric)

One public evaluation page exposes a 15-item rubric used for scoring prompts: [3]

1. Be Clear About What You Want
2. Organize Your Request Clearly
3. Tell the AI Who to Be
4. Explain Your Situation
5. Name Your Tools and Versions
6. Show What You're Looking For
7. Point to Code That Works
8. Share the Full Error Story
9. Take It One Step at a Time
10. Ask the AI to Think Out Loud
11. Say How You Want the Answer
12. Let the AI Ask Questions
13. Don't Give Opposite Instructions
14. Plan for Things Going Wrong
15. Think About Weird Situations

## Workflow Notes

- **Opt-in sharing:** The UI includes a “Share my prompt to help others” checkbox, suggesting prompts can be published as examples. [2]
- **Web search toggle (disabled in page HTML):** A “Web search with Perplexity” option appears but is disabled in the fetched page. [2]

## Pricing and Access

The promotional thread claims the tool is free. [1] The tool site also displays a “FREE” badge on at least one UI option (the badge’s exact scope isn’t clear from the static HTML alone). [2]
