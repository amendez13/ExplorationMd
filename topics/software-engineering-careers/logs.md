Gergely Orosz (The Pragmatic Engineer) shares reflections on his most impactful article about software engineering compensation, with personal data points from his time at Uber and observations on the freelancer market.

**Key Points:**
- Research-driven approach: "do your research, make a plan, then work hard and you can make it"
- Uber L5 (IC5A/5B) EU compensation was ~€250-280K (~$300-320K) TC pre-cliff, ~€220K (~$260K) post-cliff
- Negotiated better equity package than typical; no EU bands existed when he joined
- Post-IPO L5 hire TC may be somewhat lower
- Freelancer/contractor compensation typically falls in tier 2/tier 3 ranges, but is all cash with no equity component
- Expanded original US-focused research to global compensation data via blog.pragmaticengineer.com
