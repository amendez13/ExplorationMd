## The Research-Driven Approach

Maximizing tech compensation requires deliberate research and planning. As Gergely Orosz puts it: "do your research, make a plan, then work hard and you can make it."

Key elements of the research-driven approach:
- Understand company-specific level systems and bands
- Research geographic pay differences (US vs EU vs other regions)
- Learn negotiation leverage points (equity packages, signing bonuses)
- Track how compensation changes pre- and post-IPO

## Big Tech Compensation Structure

### Uber L5 Example

Concrete data points from Uber's IC5 level (L5A/5B) in Europe:

| Metric | Pre-Cliff | Post-Cliff |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Total Compensation (EUR) | €250-280K | ~€220K |
| Total Compensation (USD equivalent) | $300-320K | ~$260K |

Notes:
- These figures reflect a negotiated equity package better than typical
- No EU-specific bands existed at time of hire
- Post-IPO L5 hires may see somewhat lower TC
- L5A is entry to the level; L5B indicates progression within

### Equity Considerations

Equity is a major component of big tech compensation:
- Pre-IPO equity has higher variance but potentially higher upside
- Post-IPO compensation tends to stabilize at lower levels
- Negotiation leverage exists for equity even when base salary bands are fixed
- Cliff timing (typically 1 year) significantly affects realized compensation

## Freelancer and Contractor Market

Freelancers and contractors operate in a different compensation model:

| Aspect | Employee | Freelancer/Contractor |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| Comp tier | Tier 1 (big tech) | Tier 2/3 typically |
| Equity | Yes | No |
| Cash percentage | ~40-60% of TC | 100% |
| Benefits | Included | Self-funded |

The all-cash nature of freelance compensation means:
- Simpler tax planning (no equity vesting schedules)
- No golden handcuffs from unvested stock
- More predictable income but lower upside
- Must self-fund benefits, retirement, and gaps between contracts
