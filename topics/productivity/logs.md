### [I've Tracked 44,000 Rows of My Life Since 2014](https://psantosl.github.io/posts/16-years-of-tracking/)

Pablo Santos Luaces shares insights from 11+ years of systematic time tracking, revealing how objective data corrects perception biases about productivity. His dataset of 44,000+ rows exposed counterintuitive patterns: estimated 6-9 hours of daily work actually averaged 3.5 focused hours, and "fewer entries = better day" emerged as a productivity heuristic. An unexpected benefit was the notes field becoming a searchable life diary.

**Key Points:**
- Simple five-field schema (start, end, type, subtype, notes) ensured long-term sustainability
- Perception gap: felt unproductive despite long hours; data revealed interruption fragmentation
- Hidden time sinks only visible through aggregation (e.g., marketing at 15.4% vs. perception)
- Monotonous weeks with single projects outperformed busy multi-context weeks
- The tracking system evolved into rows.life, a product with zero-knowledge encryption
