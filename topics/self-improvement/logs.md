### [The Four Burners Theory (X Thread)](https://x.com/i/status/2023042477209624886)

A viral thread explaining David Sedaris's Four Burners Theory: your life has four burners (Family, Work, Health, Friends), and to be successful you must turn off one; to be really successful you must turn off two. The thread explores how high achievers like Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg have made these tradeoffs, and proposes rotation as a strategy for managing limited capacity across life domains.

**Key Points:**
- Success requires sacrifice; you cannot maximize all four burners simultaneously
- Family is often the first casualty because it doesn't scale and can't be delegated
- Health fails quietly until it's too late
- Friends drift away as paths diverge
- Rotation strategy: adjust burner intensity based on current life season rather than trying to maintain all at once
- Intentional design over autopilot prevents burnout
