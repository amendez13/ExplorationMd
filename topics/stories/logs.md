An OpenAI employee describes the company's internal initiative to retool engineering teams toward agentic software development. Reports a "step function improvement" in Codex capabilities since December, with engineers saying their jobs have "fundamentally changed" from using agents for unit tests to having agents write "essentially all the code."

**Key Points:**
- Goal: By March 31st, agents become the first resort for any technical task
- Recommends designating "agents captains" on each team
- Emphasizes AGENTS.md files and skills as institutional knowledge
- Warns about "slop" - functionally-correct but poorly-maintainable AI code
- Frames adoption as cultural change, not just technical tooling
