José Luis Cava analyzes the expected trajectory for major markets, cryptocurrencies, and commodities in 2026, predicting bullish conditions across hard assets driven by unprecedented liquidity injections.

**Key Points:**
- Expects a bullish year for S&P 500, Bitcoin, gold, and silver, with liquidity as the primary driver
- Western governments must refinance substantial debt; recession avoidance creates stimulus incentive
- US Treasury to deploy $900 billion from Fed accounts into real economy
- Banking capital requirement reductions could free $210-220 billion, enabling $3-5 trillion in additional credit
- AI investments (~$120 billion) generating structural demand
- S&P 500 target of 7,800 with 10% earnings growth; Bitcoin attempting to break above $100,000
