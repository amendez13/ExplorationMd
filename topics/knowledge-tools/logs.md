### [Obsidian “file over app” notes workflow (Apple Notes migration, iCloud sync, CLI search)](https://x.com/i/status/2021534318506512672)

Spanish thread describing a switch from Apple Notes to Obsidian for a file-first, Markdown-based notes workflow. Highlights reduced vendor lock-in, practical migration notes, and new CLI-based search possibilities.

**Key Points:**
- Prefers “file over app”: plain-text Markdown files on disk, reducing lock-in and making reuse easy
- Syncs across devices via iCloud (no Obsidian Sync needed for this setup); notes are not stored in an Obsidian cloud
- Apple Notes import: unlock encrypted notes first; review import logs; some manual cleanup may be required
- Corrects support plan: considering Obsidian Publish (not Sync); mentions Publish starting at $25 USD
- Notes new Obsidian CLI (initially Catalyst) enabling more efficient search, potentially useful for AI agent workflows
