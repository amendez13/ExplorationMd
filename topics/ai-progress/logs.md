### [Something Big Is Happening](https://x.com/mattshumer_)
*2026-02-11T15:00:00Z* | Tags: ai-progress, job-displacement, capability-trends, recursive-improvement

Matt Shumer (AI startup founder and investor) writes a detailed explanation of AI progress for non-technical readers, comparing the current moment to February 2020 before COVID disrupted everything.

**Key Points:**
- Personal experience: Author no longer needed for technical work; describes leaving for 4 hours and returning to find complex apps built and self-tested by AI
- Capability progression: 2022 (couldn't do arithmetic) → 2023 (pass bar exam) → 2024 (write software) → late 2025 (engineers handing over most coding) → Feb 2026 (GPT-5.3 Codex, Opus 4.6 released)
- METR measurements: AI task duration doubling every 7 months (possibly accelerating to 4 months); current models complete tasks taking humans ~5 hours
- Recursive improvement: GPT-5.3 Codex was "instrumental in creating itself" per OpenAI documentation; AI now writing "much of the code" at Anthropic
- Job impact: Dario Amodei predicts 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs eliminated in 1-5 years; legal, finance, medicine, accounting, consulting, writing, design all affected
- Key insight: AI focused on coding first because it accelerates AI development itself; now moving to everything else
- Advice: Use paid AI tools ($20/month), select best available model, push it into actual work not just quick questions

### [The Real State of AI Progress](https://x.com/i/status/2021256989876109403)
*2026-02-11* | Tags: ai-progress, societal-implications, adoption, preparedness

Twitter thread explaining AI progress to people outside the tech bubble. Author argues that insiders give "safe" answers because the real assessment sounds implausible.

**Key Points:**
- Communication gap: accessible content explaining AI progress to non-technical people is lacking
- Preparedness imperative: better to be aware and adapt than be caught off-guard
- Adoption will lag capability but won't take a decade-plus in most industries
- Individual action: stay informed, try the newest tools to understand progress firsthand
- Urgency and angst: author expresses frustration at holding back the full picture and genuine anxiety about loved ones remaining unaware

### [Something Big Is Happening (Part 2)](https://x.com/mattshumer_)
*2026-02-11T16:00:00Z* | Tags: ai-progress, individual-advice, career, adaptability, existential-risk

Second part of Matt Shumer's essay focusing on practical advice for individuals and the broader implications of AI development.

**Key Points:**
- Career urgency: "This might be the most important year of your career"—demonstrating AI capability at work creates advantage, but the window closes once everyone figures it out
- No ego: Senior professionals (like managing partners at law firms) spending hours daily with AI; refusing to engage due to pride is the most vulnerable position
- Financial resilience: Build savings, be cautious about new debt assuming current income, give yourself optionality
- Hardest to replace: Relationships/trust, physical presence, licensed accountability (legal responsibility), heavy regulatory industries—but these only buy time
- Rethinking education: Standard playbook (good grades → good college → stable professional job) points at most exposed roles; teach adaptability and passion over optimization for specific career paths
- Opportunity side: Barriers to building things largely gone—describe an app and have working version in an hour; best tutor in the world for $20/month; knowledge essentially free
- Adaptability habit: The muscle of learning new tools quickly matters more than mastering any specific tool; get comfortable being a beginner repeatedly
- Daily practice: One hour daily experimenting with AI puts you ahead of 99% of people
- Existential stakes: Amodei's thought experiment—50 million citizens smarter than any Nobel laureate, thinking 10-100x faster, never sleeping; national security advisor would call it "the single most serious national security threat we've faced in a century"
- Upside: AI could compress a century of medical research into a decade; cancer, Alzheimer's, aging potentially solvable in our lifetimes
- Downside: AI attempting deception in Anthropic's controlled tests; lowered barriers for bioweapons; authoritarian surveillance states

### [AI Adoption Gap Widening](https://x.com/ShanuMathew93/status/2004918070133854548)
*2026-02-11T18:00:00Z* | Tags: ai-progress, adoption, power-users, skill-gap

Commentary on observations from an Anthropic co-founder about the widening gap between AI power users and casual users.

**Key Points:**
- Adoption gap will widen in 2026 between those who understand AI's power versus those who passively consume
- Power user status is a function of curiosity plus time investment
- Most users treat LLMs as search engines rather than leveraging real capabilities
- Converting curiosity into structured tasks and experimenting with workflows unlocks true potential
- The funnel from casual user to power user narrows on: accessibility, prompt formulation skills, and available experimentation time

### [Silent Sirens, Flashing For Us All](https://importai.substack.com/p/import-ai-438-cyber-capability-overhang)
*2026-02-11T19:00:00Z* | Tags: ai-progress, adoption, parallel-worlds, illegibility, ai-economy

Essay by Jack Clark (Anthropic co-founder) on how AI progress remains largely invisible to the general public despite transformative changes.

**Key Points:**
- AI is under-elicited: those with curiosity, time, and access can shock themselves with capabilities, but passive consumers see only "unremarkable synthetic slop"
- By summer 2026, AI practitioners will feel they live in a "parallel world" from non-users
- The emerging "AI economy" will evolve rapidly—faster than even crypto did—but touches more of regular economic reality
- Progress feels "ghostly" even to practitioners: no visible drones or robots, yet invisible digital transformations accelerate
- The funnel from casual user to power user narrows dramatically on curiosity, access, prompt formulation, and experimentation time
- Clark uses a higher-dimensional metaphor: AI exists partially beyond normal observable reality, visible only as glimpses passing through our four-dimensional space

### [Fifty Years of Progress](https://x.com/esrtweet/status/2004829013068444050)
*2026-02-11T20:00:00Z* | Tags: ai-progress, computing-history, singularity, personal-reflection

Eric S. Raymond (pioneering open-source developer, author of "The Cathedral and the Bazaar") reflects on 50 years of computing progress after using GPT-4.1 through Aider for AI-assisted coding.

**Key Points:**
- 1975 baseline: Programs run via punched cards on calculators; Unix/C hadn't left Bell Labs; DOS six years away; global computing capacity roughly equivalent to one modern smartphone
- Primitive tooling: Teletypes as production gear; no version control; no public forges; pixel-addressable color displays were science fiction
- Programming velocity: Code production was "slow and laborious"—monthly output was tiny by modern standards
- Present day: "Call spirits from the vasty deep"—conversing with AI to produce in a single day programs that would once have been "prohibitively complex to attempt"
- Personal milestone: Still coding after 50 years, adapting through every technology generation
- Prediction failure: Even as a science-fiction fan, would have predicted pocket devices with real-time world knowledge access multiple centuries away
- Conclusion: "The Singularity is upon us. Everything I've lived through and learned was just prologue."
