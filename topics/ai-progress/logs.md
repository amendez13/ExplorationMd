### [Something Big Is Happening](https://x.com/mattshumer_)
*2026-02-11T15:00:00Z* | Tags: ai-progress, job-displacement, capability-trends, recursive-improvement

Matt Shumer (AI startup founder and investor) writes a detailed explanation of AI progress for non-technical readers, comparing the current moment to February 2020 before COVID disrupted everything.

**Key Points:**
- Personal experience: Author no longer needed for technical work; describes leaving for 4 hours and returning to find complex apps built and self-tested by AI
- Capability progression: 2022 (couldn't do arithmetic) → 2023 (pass bar exam) → 2024 (write software) → late 2025 (engineers handing over most coding) → Feb 2026 (GPT-5.3 Codex, Opus 4.6 released)
- METR measurements: AI task duration doubling every 7 months (possibly accelerating to 4 months); current models complete tasks taking humans ~5 hours
- Recursive improvement: GPT-5.3 Codex was "instrumental in creating itself" per OpenAI documentation; AI now writing "much of the code" at Anthropic
- Job impact: Dario Amodei predicts 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs eliminated in 1-5 years; legal, finance, medicine, accounting, consulting, writing, design all affected
- Key insight: AI focused on coding first because it accelerates AI development itself; now moving to everything else
- Advice: Use paid AI tools ($20/month), select best available model, push it into actual work not just quick questions

### [The Real State of AI Progress](https://x.com/i/status/2021256989876109403)
*2026-02-11* | Tags: ai-progress, societal-implications, adoption, preparedness

Twitter thread explaining AI progress to people outside the tech bubble. Author argues that insiders give "safe" answers because the real assessment sounds implausible.

**Key Points:**
- Communication gap: accessible content explaining AI progress to non-technical people is lacking
- Preparedness imperative: better to be aware and adapt than be caught off-guard
- Adoption will lag capability but won't take a decade-plus in most industries
- Individual action: stay informed, try the newest tools to understand progress firsthand
- Urgency and angst: author expresses frustration at holding back the full picture and genuine anxiety about loved ones remaining unaware
