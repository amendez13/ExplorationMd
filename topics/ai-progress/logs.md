Twitter thread explaining AI progress to people outside the tech bubble. Author argues that insiders give "safe" answers because the real assessment sounds implausible.

**Key Points:**
- Communication gap: accessible content explaining AI progress to non-technical people is lacking
- Preparedness imperative: better to be aware and adapt than be caught off-guard
- Adoption will lag capability but won't take a decade-plus in most industries
- Individual action: stay informed, try the newest tools to understand progress firsthand
