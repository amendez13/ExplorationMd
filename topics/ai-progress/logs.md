### [The Real State of AI Progress](https://x.com/i/status/2021256989876109403)
*2026-02-11* | Tags: ai-progress, capability-trends, cost-dynamics, adoption

Twitter thread aimed at explaining AI progress to people outside the tech bubble. Author argues that the safe explanations understate reality.

**Key Points:**
- AI developers report their productivity has changed fundamentally; projects that took weeks now take hours
- Model capability improvements are rapid (GPT-5.3-Codex cited as "significantly better" than GPT-4.6)
- Cost dynamics: equivalent intelligence gets cheaper over time, but frontier capability maintains premium pricing
- Adoption will lag capability - enterprise spending will increase even as consumer patterns remain uncertain
