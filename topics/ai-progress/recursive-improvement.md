## Overview

Recursive improvement refers to AI systems contributing to the development of their own successors—each generation helping build the next, which is smarter, which builds the next faster, which is smarter still [1].

This is no longer a theoretical future scenario. Per OpenAI's technical documentation for GPT-5.3 Codex (released February 5, 2026): "GPT-5.3-Codex is our first model that was instrumental in creating itself. The Codex team used early versions to debug its own training, manage its own deployment, and diagnose test results and evaluations" [1].

## Why Coding Came First

The AI labs made a deliberate strategic choice: focus on making AI great at writing code first [1].

**The reasoning**:
- Building AI requires a lot of code
- If AI can write that code, it can help build the next version of itself
- A smarter version writes better code, which builds an even smarter version
- Making AI great at coding was the strategy that unlocks everything else

This explains why software engineers experienced AI disruption earlier than other fields—not because labs were targeting them specifically, but as a side effect of where they chose to aim first [1].

The implication: now that code-writing capability is achieved, labs are "moving on to everything else" [1].

## Current Evidence

**OpenAI**: GPT-5.3 Codex helped create itself, as documented in the model's technical release [1].

**Anthropic**: Dario Amodei (CEO) states that AI is now writing "much of the code" at the company, and that the feedback loop between current AI and next-generation AI is "gathering steam month by month" [1].

Amodei's timeline estimate: "only 1–2 years away from a point where the current generation of AI autonomously builds the next" [1].

## The Intelligence Explosion Thesis

The researchers call this dynamic an "intelligence explosion"—and the people building these systems believe the process has already started [1].

The feedback loop:
1. Current AI helps write code for training infrastructure
2. This accelerates development of next-generation AI
3. Next generation is more capable at helping build its successor
4. Each cycle completes faster than the previous

This is distinct from incremental improvement. It's a self-reinforcing acceleration curve.

## Implications

If the recursive improvement thesis is correct:
- Progress timelines based on historical pace may underestimate future speed
- The primary bottleneck shifts from human researcher hours to compute availability
- Capability gains could compress into much shorter timeframes than expected

The CEO of the most safety-focused major AI lab (Anthropic) publicly predicts AI "substantially smarter than almost all humans at almost all tasks" arriving in 2026-2027 [1].
