## Why Better Tools Don’t Automatically Mean Less Work

A common story about AI is that productivity gains should translate into fewer hours worked. One counterpoint, raised in the context of AI startups, is that time savings are often reinvested into doing *more*—because performance is evaluated relative to competitors using the same tools [1].

In that view, widespread access to better tools shifts the baseline: if everyone can move faster, “average” output expectations increase, and teams push harder to outcompete rather than to reclaim time [1].

## Mechanism: The Competitive “Ratcheting” Effect

When improvement is relative, tool adoption can create a ratchet:

- **Tools raise the floor**: New capabilities become table stakes; what was previously “great output” becomes “expected” [1].
- **Competition reallocates gains**: Instead of fewer hours, time and budget shift into higher throughput or higher quality to stay ahead [1].
- **Arms-race dynamics**: In high-stakes environments (e.g., startups racing for product/market fit), teams may maximize iteration speed, even if tools could have reduced labor [1].

## Implications

- **For individuals**: Productivity tools can increase scope and ambition; guarding focus and burnout becomes more important when “you could do more” is always true [1].
- **For teams**: If competitors adopt the same accelerators, differentiation tends to move from raw speed to taste, quality, distribution, and decision-making—while still using AI to increase output [1].
- **For labor predictions**: Forecasts of “less work” need an explicit assumption about whether the relevant market is capacity-constrained (work expands) or demand-constrained (work contracts) [1].
