## Productivity Compression

Developers using frontier AI models report transformational productivity gains. Tasks that previously required weeks can be completed in hours with AI assistance [1].

## Cost Dynamics

Token costs for frontier models don't drop significantly at any given capability level. However, to achieve the same level of intelligence, costs decrease substantially over time.

**Pattern**: Today's "150 IQ" model costs X per token. Next year, "150 IQ" tokens will be significantly cheaper, but a new "200 IQ" model will be available at roughly the same X price point [1].

Result: costs continuously drop for equivalent capability, but the ceiling keeps rising.

## Model Recommendations

For best results as of early 2026 [1]:
- **ChatGPT**: GPT-5.2 Pro (significant step up from default)
- **Codex**: GPT-5.3-Codex (significantly better than previous versions)
- **Claude**: Opus 4.5
