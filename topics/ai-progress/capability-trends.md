## Capability Timeline

The pace of AI improvement has been dramatic [2]:

- **2022**: AI couldn't do basic arithmetic reliably (would confidently state 7 × 8 = 54)
- **2023**: Passed the bar exam
- **2024**: Could write working software and explain graduate-level science
- **Late 2025**: Top engineers reported handing over most coding work to AI
- **February 5, 2026**: GPT-5.3 Codex and Opus 4.6 released, marking another step change

The key insight: AI focused on coding first because code-writing ability accelerates AI development itself. Making AI great at coding was the strategy that unlocks everything else [2].

## Productivity Compression

Developers using frontier AI models report transformational productivity gains. Tasks that previously required weeks can be completed in hours with AI assistance [1].

Current experience from practitioners [2]:
- Describing desired app in plain English, walking away for 4 hours, returning to find it built
- AI writes tens of thousands of lines of code that work correctly
- AI opens the app, clicks through buttons, tests features, iterates on its own
- AI demonstrates something resembling judgment and taste—knowing "what the right call is"

## METR Task Duration Measurements

METR tracks the length of real-world tasks (measured by human expert completion time) that AI can complete successfully end-to-end without human help [2]:

- ~1 year ago: ~10 minutes
- Then: ~1 hour
- Then: several hours
- November 2025 (Claude Opus 4.5): ~5 hours

**Doubling rate**: Approximately every 7 months, with recent data suggesting acceleration to as fast as every 4 months.

If trend continues:
- Days of independent work: within ~1 year
- Weeks of independent work: within ~2 years
- Month-long projects: within ~3 years

## Cost Dynamics

Token costs for frontier models don't drop significantly at any given capability level. However, to achieve the same level of intelligence, costs decrease substantially over time.

**Pattern**: Today's "150 IQ" model costs X per token. Next year, "150 IQ" tokens will be significantly cheaper, but a new "200 IQ" model will be available at roughly the same X price point [1].

Result: costs continuously drop for equivalent capability, but the ceiling keeps rising.

## Model Recommendations

For best results as of early 2026:
- **ChatGPT**: GPT-5.2 Pro or GPT-5.3 Codex [1, 2]
- **Claude**: Opus 4.5 or Opus 4.6 [1, 2]

Important: Default models in free tiers are often a year or more behind what paying users access. Select the most capable model explicitly in settings [2].
