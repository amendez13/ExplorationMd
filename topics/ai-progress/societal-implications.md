## The Communication Gap

People inside the AI industry routinely give "safe" answers when asked about progress because the real assessment sounds implausible to outsiders [1]. There's a lack of accessible content bridging the gap between technical insiders and the general public.

## Individual Preparedness

The core message: preparation matters regardless of exact timelines. Even if adoption takes longer than expected, awareness and adaptation are better than denial [1].

Key framing: people should stay informed about frontier models and try the newest tools to understand the rate of progress firsthand.

## Adoption Timeline

Capability will arrive before widespread adoption. Enterprise spending will increase, but consumer patterns remain uncertain. Most industries won't take a decade-plus to adapt, but exceptions will exist [1].

The advice: be prepared now rather than caught off-guard later.
